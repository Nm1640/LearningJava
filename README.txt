This is a simple shopping list for java.
it has 3 main options Add, Remove, and check out.
Adding will start a loop where you can add as much as you want. after you're done you type back
removing is the same thing it will start a loop where you can remove from the arraylist till you type back
check out will simply display your list one last time and close the main loop turning off the program
